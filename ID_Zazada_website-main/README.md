A website done from scratch for the module Interactive Development Assignment 2.
The website is about a fictional eCommerce site "Zazada".

## Design Process

This website is for Zazada to promote and sell the items of various categories such as electronic devices, fashion, health and beauty etc. Potential buyers would be able to view the items offered by Zazada and also view the price and description of the items.
- As a potential user, I want to check the promotions availble, so that I can find out if there are any deals.
- As a user with feedback, I want to submit my feedback, so that I can help improve the website.
- As the owners, I want to update the website with updated and accurate information, so that I can attract more potentials users.
- As a potential user, I want to find the cheapeast way to buy the product I want including games that would reward the player.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Responsive Feedback form - allows users to provide feedback, by having them fill out the form.
- A search bar for users to search for the specific items they have in mind.
- A game that allows users to get vouchers to offset their next purchase based on how far they manage to get through the game.
- A log in and register system for users to register new accounts and to log into exisiting one.


### Features Left to Implement
- A cart system which saves users choices should they wish to have some more time to think about the purchase.

- A review system for users to leave reviews on items they have purchased to better inform others.
